<p>
  My love of programming centers on the joy I feel when I work with technology that eases and enriches the lives of those around me through the melding of creative and technical solutions.<br /><br />
  I love <strong>diving deep</strong> into problems and <strong>building beautiful technologies</strong>, especially if that means I'm <strong>learning something new</strong> and gaining a better understanding of how to create more sophisticated
  answers.<br /><br />
  I thrive when working within <strong>inspiring</strong> and <strong>collaborative</strong> teams as my experience has taught me an elaborate sense of teamwork, dedication, agile workflow, and the <strong>importance of culture</strong> in an
  otherwise technical field.<br /><br />
  I'm looking for an opportunity to work as a full-stack web developer on new technologies and create great products that allow me to build <strong>clean, modular, organized, and well-tested code</strong> and where I can learn while contributing my
  best work.<br /><br />
